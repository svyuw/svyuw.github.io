      <h2>Reflection on Game Assignment</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p> For this assignment, we were assigned to make a game using the p5 Play library. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To start off, I went through the practice activities to help me set up my own dev toolchain. Once I felt more comfortbale with setting the 
        toolchain up, I also explored the p5 Play library and what capabilities it had. I discussed with my classmates potential game ideas and landed on the idea 
        of having a cat chase mice around and score points. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        My first step of making the game was to create a sprite and have this sprite be moveable. I wanted the sprite to move around with the arrow keys. 
        I created the characters, the cat and the mouse, on Figma and made them into animations. These are that the animations look like: 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div>
            Here is a demo of what the pet looked like as I was working on it: 
              <img src="cat.gif" class="gif">
              <img src="mouse.gif" class="gif">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        I started with making the sprite for the cat. I had a decent amount of trouble getting the gifs to appear on screen, but with some help from both 
        Hannah and Reina we figured it out. Once the cat was a moveable sprite, I adjusted the look of the cat to my liking. Then, I was able to create the mice 
        and have them be the gifs of a mouse. I then turned my attention to making them catchable by the cat as well as having all of the assets on the page be contained in 
        a barrier. This makes them turn around and run back onto the screen once they bump into the barrier. <a href="https://svyuw.github.io/mousecatgame/">Here is the link to my game!</a>

          Here is a demo of what the pet looked like as I was working on it with the characters running off screen: 
            <img src="progresscat2.gif" class="gif"> <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>

          Here is a demo of everything put together: <br>

      <h3>Issues </h3>
      <p>This assignment was a bit difficult for me because it was my first time (in a long time) creating a dev toolchain and pushing something for deployment, so I was a 
        bit confused with all the steps that went into it. However, after asking some friends and especially looking at the Discord, I was able to piece together the 
        solution. I also struggled for a while with making the gifs show up and making the cat moveable. I went in for office hours and asked Reina for assistance with 
        making the cat move, which was very helpful. My last issue that I had to work on was how to make the cat eat the mice, and ended up being able to use <code>collideCircleCircle</code>
        and putting that within the same forloop that would check if the mice is within the canvas. 
        <br>
        This is an example of what my game looked like as I was trying to figure out how to move the cat and format it properly:

      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="progress1.gif" class="gif">
      </div>
      

      <h3>Ideas and Future Work</h3>
      <p>Some ideas for the future include: 
        <ul style=“list-style-type:circle>

          <li>I would have really liked to make the cat run into items and make it go faster/slower</li>
          
          <li>created a cute pop-up to introduce the game / when the game ends a pop-up asks user if it would like to play again</li>
          
          <li>create a leader board for the game</li>
          
          </ul>

      </p>
