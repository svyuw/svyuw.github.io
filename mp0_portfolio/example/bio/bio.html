        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Sarah Yang, a current senior at the University of Washington. I am in the Human Centered Design and Engineering major in the College of Engineering. I believe in the importance and intersectionality of design and technology, and I want to use my education and skills to help others.
            Design is my way of storytelling and connecting with others. I work diligently to get the job done and think that creating a safe and encouraging space is key for working in a team. I am passionate about topics such as inclusivity, accessibility, and gender, sexuality, and race studies. I am based in Seattle and am currently interested in UX/UI design opportunities.
