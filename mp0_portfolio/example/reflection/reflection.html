      <h2>Reflection on MP0</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p> In order to make this portfolio site, I first had to set up my computer by downloading 
        VS Code and Github Desktop. I then copied over the parts from the example into my own folder and 
        then decided how I wanted my portfolio to look. I created a page for my bio, cheatsheet, and this reflection.
        I also left placehodlers for future projects. Once I had this skeleton of a portfolio, I went in with adding in 
        pictures, transitions, and creating little icons for my site on Figma.

          Here is what the home page looked like as I was working on it:

      </p>
      <h3>Issues </h3>
      <p>I had a hard time initially downlaoding VS Code and Github, and setting everything up was a little confusing for me. 
        However, it got easier with getting reaquainted with coding again (it has been a couple years). I also had issues
        pushing to Github, but after some time it somehow began to work again. Something that helped me a lot was knowing when
        to ask for help or stop and take a break and revist my work, because I tend to get frustrated. I think that my biggest mountain to climb was 
        just relearning how coding works, how to format things, and reminding myself to have patience. In past classes, I haven't 
        really enjoyed coding that much, but I am optimistic that this class will help me have fun with coding :)
