      <h1>MP0 Reflection</h1>
      <h2>Reflection on MP0</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p> In order to make this portfolio site, I first had to set up my computer by downloading 
        VS Code and Github Desktop. I then copied over the parts from the example into my own folder and 
        then decided how I wanted my portfolio to look. I created a page for my bio, cheatsheet, and this reflection.
        I also left placehodlers for future projects. Once I had this skeleton of a portfolio, I went in with adding in 
        pictures, transitions, and creating little icons for my site on Figma. 
        
        <div>
          Here is what the home page looked like as I was working on it: 
            <img src="progresspic.png" class="image">
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Issues </h3>
      <p>I had a hard time initially downlaoding VS Code and Github, and setting everything up was a little confusing for me. 
        However, it got easier with getting reaquainted with coding again (it has been a couple years). I also had issues
        pushing to Github, but after some time it somehow began to work again. Something that helped me a lot was knowing when
        to ask for help or stop and take a break and revist my work, because I tend to get frustrated. This is my first time front end coding 
        and the first coding class I've taken in a year or two. I think that my biggest mountain to climb was 
        just relearning how coding works, how to format things, and reminding myself to have patience. In past classes, I haven't 
        really enjoyed coding that much, but I am optimistic that this class will help me have fun with coding :)

      <h3>CSS Transition </h3>
      <p>This CSS transition took me a bit of time to figure out, but I'm happy with how it looks. I wanted to have a hover
        transition that displayed the name of the tab with a pink background. I started out with changing the images and then doing some reasearch on 
        how others have achieved a similar effect. I then made each of the images their own container, and used a pink overlay to 
        have a background for the text. The group of tabs are in a big container to help with sectioning. I chose this transition because 
        I thought it would be a fun and interactive way to learn about each page that I have on my portfolio and inform the user about 
        the pages on the site. I also did this because I chose a very minimal icon style which doesn't necessarily give a lot of information 
        about each project. Another transition I utilized was having the nav icons jiggle a little when the user 
        hovers over them. I think if I did this again, I would prioritize having a plan for how I want my portfolio to look like so 
        I am not backtracking and making things more complicated for myself. 
          
        Here is what the CSS transmission looks like:
      <div>
        <img src="gif_AdobeExpress.gif" class="gif">
      </div>
      </p>

      <h3>Ideas and Future </h3>
      <p>Some ideas for the future include: 
        <ul style=â€œlist-style-type:circle>

          <li>adding buttons to navigate to other project pages on each project page</li>
          
          <li>having more animations or interactive features on home and bio pages</li>
          
          <li>look up other formats for portfolios and try to implement other cool features</li>
          
          </ul>
