      <h2>Final Project Sub-Page</h2>
      <h3>Final Project Proposal</h3>
      <p> For this assignment, I will be extending my web extension project and combining it with Unsplash API and Removal.AI to make random images of cats bounce around the user's screen.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Prototype Version</h3>
        <p> For my prototype version of this evolved web extension, I will be focusing on the core functionality of using the API to generate the images
            and having them bounce around the user's page. I will hardcode specific filters such as breed and category and mainly focus on making the API work with the 
            browser extension.
            </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Final Version</h3>
        <p> For my final version of this web extension, I would like to give the user the option to select which type of image they would like to bounce 
            around their screen (static/animated, category such as animals or nature, and the option to choose a random picture). 
            </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Sketches</h3>
        <p> Here are my two sketches for my final project:</p>
        <div>
            <img src="catsketch1.png" class="picture">
            <img src="catsketch2.png" class="picture">
         </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Research the Unsplash API and figure out how to fetch the images from the API</li>
            <li>Implement the Unsplash API into my previous web extension code</li>
            <li>Prototype Milestone: the random images can bounce around the user's page</li>
            <li>Make the browser extension more personalizable through filters</li>
            <li>Try implementing the Removal.AI API into my previous web extension code</li>
            <li>Make the extension pretty</li>
            <li>Deploy and make publically accessible</li>
            <li>Final Milestone: put all the parts together</li>
         </ol>
        <br>
        <br>

      <h3>Unknowns</h3>
      <p>
        <ul style=“list-style-type:circle>
          <li>It has been a long time since I've used APIs, so I am curious how easy or hard it will be to use</li> 
          <li>How to make the extension more personalized</li>   
          </ul>

      </p>
      </p>

      <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
      <p>Some ideas for the future include: 
        <ul style=“list-style-type:circle>
          <li>Let the user interact with the image in some way -- like when the user clicks on the image, it meows</li> 
          <li>Let the user control how the image moves in some way?</li>      
          </ul>
