      <h1>MP2 Reflection</h1>
      <h2>Reflection on Sound Exploration Assignment</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p> For this assignment, we made six sketches using P5.js to make art with code. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To start off, I took some time to experiment with the P5.js editor. I started with the static image and thought about what I would like to make -- 
        I decided on a fun and bright static image of a person. With this sketch, I used a <code>forloop</code> to create the background. For my second sketch, I didn't really 
        have a plan for what I wanted my sketch to look like, but I started with generating random shapes (ellipses, rectangles, and triangles) that would populate the background.
        I also had them be random colors. I wanted to have a centerpiece to the sketch, so I made a static heart in the middle of the canvas. With my third sketch, I felt 
        like I wanted to carry on with the rainbow / heart theme that I had going, so I tried making a heart that changed colors. I first made a singular small heart 
        through reusing the same code as in my second sketch. My next step was to make it loop through the colors of the rainbow. Then, I accidentally made the heart grow bigger -- 
        which turned out to be an accident that I liked the result of. For my fourth sketch, I made an interactive sketch where the user can draw on the canvas and have rainbow
        circles appear. These circles are closer together based off of speed of the user's mouse, and fade after a couple of seconds. My fifth sketch consists of the user clicking the 
        canvas to play the sound "Be Your Girl (Kaytranada Edition)" by Teedra Moses and KAYTRANADA. If the user hasn't clicked the canvas, there is just a pink screen that says 
        "click me to party!". After the user has clicked on the canvas, the screen turns different colors based on the position of the mouse on the canvas. My final sketch 
        consists of sound input that results in rainbow colored circles that are larger if the sound input is larger. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <div>
            Here is what sketch four looks looks like: 
            <br>
              <img src="sketch4.gif" class="gif">
          </div>
        <br>
             To break down my process a bit more, I will discuss sketch three, the infinite loop sketch. To start, I reused the heart from my previous sketch.
             Then, I made the heart grow and shrink by setting a min, max, and original size for the heart to loop through. Once the heart has reached its max size, 
             it will start shrinking. Once the heart has reached its min size, the heart will start growing again.
             Here, you can see the stroke growing and shrinking. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div>
            Here is a demo of what the heart looked like as I was working on it: 
              <img src="sketch3.1.gif" class="gif">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        I then made it so that the fill was the rainbow by using <code>colorMode(HSB)</code> and then cycling through the colors. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <div>
          Here is a demo of what the heart looked like as I was working on it: 
            <img src="sketch3.2.gif" class="gif"> <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        I originally wanted to make six hearts appear on a grid with them all changing colors. However, after playing around with the code, I liked how smooth the 
        gradient was when I made the max size larger than the canvas width and height. One problem with my code for this heart is that if the screen is bigger than 
        the max size that I set, then the user will see the blank canvas behind the heart. If I had more time, I think that I would try and make it so that the 
        max size automatically adjusts to the size of the screen.

          Here is a demo of everything put together: <br>

      <h3>Issues </h3>
      <p>With this class, I'm focusing on actually trying to enjoy the process of coding instead of biting too big of a bite with my projects and getting frustrated 
        and stressed by it. I wanted to make something simple and cute that would bring a smile to anyone using it. Overall, I think my most dealt with roadblock while doing this project
        was how long it takes me to read, process, understand, and then code. It just takes me longer than I would prefer to make progress on my projects. With that being said, I had a 
        bit of a confusing time figuring out how to correctly format the gif of the seal into where the block was. I ended up making a container to hold the container that was holding the gif
        of the pet. Then, after experimenting with the code, I found that the best way to format the containers was keeping the <code>.page-pet__container</code> with an absolute position
        and having the <code>.inside-container</code> have a relative position. During this process of looking up possible solutions, I also learned about <code>z-index</code> and decided to use it to 
        make it easier to make the pets bounce around the page.
