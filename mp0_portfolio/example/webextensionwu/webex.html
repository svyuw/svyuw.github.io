      <h2>Reflection on Web Extension Assignment</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p> For this assignment, we made a web extension. I made a page pet extension that lets the user add a cute pet 
        to the page that they are on. Once the pet is added, the user can click on the pet and have it bounce around the page. 
        To stop the pet from bouncing, the user just has to click on the pet again. To say goodbye to the pet, the user clicks the 'x'
        to the bottom right of the pet. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To start off, I locally downloaded the 'extension-toolkit' folder and copied the code for the 'blocker' extension. 
        This helped me get a good framework to work off of. To start my code, I formatted the popup. I found a cute pixel gif of a pet on Google
        and then put it in the popup. I also changed the text to fit it a bit better. With the popup semi-done, I moved on to making the pet appear on the page. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <div>
            Here is what the pop up looked like as I was working on it: 
            <br>
              <img src="progresspopup.gif" class="gif">
          </div>
        <br>
        My first step of making the pet go on the page was to figure out how to put the gif of the cute seal where the 
        block would be, which was a bit difficult for me to figure out, but I was able to modify the code and add in the gif. 
        I then made sure the background of the gif was transparent and formatted the pet to my preferences. After successfully
        implementing the pet in the space of the block, I then changed the 'delete' button to be an icon. I wanted to add in another
        feature to the pet, so I decided to make it bounce around the page. I looked up some tutorials and examples that others posted online
        and then made the seal bounce around the page through using a linear infinite alternate animation on the x and y axis of the pet. 
        I made the pet look like it was bouncing through @keyframes on the x and y axis and then subtracting the dimensions of the actual pet: <code>transform: translateX(calc(100vw - 200px))</code>.
        To stop the pet, the user just has to click on the pet again. The checkmark in the popup makes the all the pets visible or invisible, so if the pets get too overwhelming the 
        user can just click on the checkmark to make them all go away.

          <div>
            Here is a demo of what the pet looked like as I was working on it: 
              <img src="petbouncing.gif" class="gif">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        I then went back to focusing on the popup. I made a simple icon in Figma to use as a cover for this portfolio as well as use for the extension icon.
        I put that as the icon for the extension, and then modified the button and added some text to tell the user that they can click on the seal to make it bounce around the screen. 
        I have not published the extension and I don't really plan to, but for this assignment I ran it locally.

          Here is a demo of everything put together: <br>

      <h3>Issues </h3>
      <p>With this class, I'm focusing on actually trying to enjoy the process of coding instead of biting too big of a bite with my projects and getting frustrated 
        and stressed by it. I wanted to make something simple and cute that would bring a smile to anyone using it. Overall, I think my most dealt with roadblock while doing this project
        was how long it takes me to read, process, understand, and then code. It just takes me longer than I would prefer to make progress on my projects. With that being said, I had a 
        bit of a confusing time figuring out how to correctly format the gif of the seal into where the block was. I ended up making a container to hold the container that was holding the gif
        of the pet. Then, after experimenting with the code, I found that the best way to format the containers was keeping the <code>.page-pet__container</code> with an absolute position
        and having the <code>.inside-container</code> have a relative position. During this process of looking up possible solutions, I also learned about <code>z-index</code> and decided to use it to 
        make it easier to make the pets bounce around the page.

      <h3>Ideas and Future Work</h3>
      <p>Some ideas for the future include: 
        <ul style=“list-style-type:circle>

          <li>I would really like to add other page pets that the user can choose from (like a dog!)</li>
          
          <li>I think it would be cute if the page pets could speak to the user and maybe say funny things to cheer up the viewer.</li>
          
          <li>Adding more personalization -- changing colors of the pets, maybe being able to move the pet around the page, somehow feeding the pet?</li>
          
          </ul>

      </p>
