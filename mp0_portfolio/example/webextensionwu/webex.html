      <h2>Reflection on Web Extension Assignment</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p> For this assignment, we made a web extension. I made a page pet extension that lets the user add a cute pet 
        to the page that they are on. Once the pet is added, the user can click on the pet and have it bounce around the page. 
        To stop the pet from bouncing, the user just has to click on the pet again. To say goodbye to the pet, the user clicks the 'x'
        to the bottom right of the pet. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To start off, I locally downloaded the 'extension-toolkit' folder and copied the code for the 'blocker' extension. 
        This helped me get a good framework to work off of. To start my code, I formatted the popup. I found a cute pixel gif of a pet on Google
        and then put it in the popup. I also changed the text to fit it a bit better. With the popup semi-done, I moved on to making the pet appear on the page. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <div>
            Here is what the pop up looked like as I was working on it: 
            <br>
              <img src="progresspopup.gif" class="gif">
          </div>
        <br>
        My first step of making the pet go on the page was to figure out how to put the gif of the cute seal where the 
        block would be, which was a bit difficult for me to figure out, but I was able to modify the code and add in the gif. 
        I then made sure the background of the gif was transparent and formatted the pet to my preferences. After successfully
        implementing the pet in the space of the block, I then changed the 'delete' button to be an icon. I wanted to add in another
        feature to the pet, so I decided to make it bounce around the page. I looked up some tutorials and examples that others posted online
        and then made the seal bounce around the page through using a linear infinite alternate animation on the x and y axis of the pet. 
        I made the pet look like it was bouncing through @keyframes on the x and y axis and then subtracting the dimensions of the actual pet: <code>transform: translateX(calc(100vw - 200px))</code>.
        To stop the pet, the user just has to click on the pet again. The checkmark in the popup makes the all the pets visible or invisible, so if the pets get too overwhelming the 
        user can just click on the checkmark to make them all go away.

          <div>
            Here is a demo of what the pet looked like as I was working on it: 
              <img src="petbouncing.gif" class="gif">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        I then went back to focusing on the popup. I made a simple icon in Figma to use as a cover for this portfolio as well as use for the extension icon.
        I put that as the icon for the extension, and then modified the button and added some text to tell the user that they can click on the seal to make it bounce around the screen.

        <div>
          Here is a demo of what the pet looked like as I was working on it: 
            <img src="final popup.gif" class="gif"> <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div>
          Here is a demo of everything put together: <br>
            <img src="final_bounce.gif" class="gif">

      <h3>Issues </h3>
      <p>I had a hard time initially downlaoding VS Code and Github, and setting everything up was a little confusing for me. 
        However, it got easier with getting reaquainted with coding again (it has been a couple years). I also had issues
        pushing to Github, but after some time it somehow began to work again. Something that helped me a lot was knowing when
        to ask for help or stop and take a break and revist my work, because I tend to get frustrated. This is my first time front end coding 
        and the first coding class I've taken in a year or two. I think that my biggest mountain to climb was 
        just relearning how coding works, how to format things, and reminding myself to have patience. In past classes, I haven't 
        really enjoyed coding that much, but I am optimistic that this class will help me have fun with coding :)

      <h3>CSS Transition </h3>
      <p>This CSS transition took me a bit of time to figure out, but I'm happy with how it looks. I wanted to have a hover
        transition that displayed the name of the tab with a pink background. I started out with changing the images and then doing some reasearch on 
        how others have achieved a similar effect. I then made each of the images their own container, and used a pink overlay to 
        have a background for the text. The group of tabs are in a big container to help with sectioning. I chose this transition because 
        I thought it would be a fun and interactive way to learn about each page that I have on my portfolio and inform the user about 
        the pages on the site. I also did this because I chose a very minimal icon style which doesn't necessarily give a lot of information 
        about each project. Another transition I utilized was having the nav icons jiggle a little when the user 
        hovers over them. I think if I did this again, I would prioritize having a plan for how I want my portfolio to look like so 
        I am not backtracking and making things more complicated for myself. 
          
        Here is what the CSS transmission looks like:
      <div>
        <img src="progresspopup.gif" class="gif">
      </div>
      </p>
